It seeks it's OWN desires over the needs of another. It goes away when the other person is not doing exactly what feels good to or for you. There is no follow-through, no [staying power] with lust because it is feelings-based. This means when our feelings change, lust goes away.

(I am recieving my dad's BMW [X5])($58,000) Dont worry, if you crash your German Luxury Car, your dad WILL buy you another. \r\n\r\nGarden City HS teens are also extremely good at sports, particulary lacrosse. [Manhasset] is the Garden City rival. \r\n\r\nThere is no diversity in Garden City. In [Garden City High School], there are approximately 1200 students. Of those 1196 of them are white. The few black kids are excluded. \r\n\r\nGCHS Teens tend to get into exceptional colleges, many Ivy League.

The  girls wear Juicy Couture and only carry handbags from Louis Vuitton, Gucci or [Fendi]. \r\n\r\nIt is extremely common practice for a Garden City HS teen, upon getting his/her license, to be given a Luxury SUV such as  BMW or Mercedes. (I guess, they are more Like \"Luxury Activity Vehicles\") I go to GCHS, and one of my friends recently recieved a Range Rover Sport [Supercharged] (its like $80,000) and another recieved a new 5series BMW ($50,000) , another a Mercedes ML500 ($55,000). (I am recieving my dad's BMW [X5])($58,000) Dont worry, if you crash your German Luxury Car, your dad WILL buy you another. \r\n\r\nGarden City HS teens are also extremely good at sports, particulary lacrosse. [Manhasset] is the Garden City rival. \r\n\r\nThere is no diversity in Garden City. In [Garden City High School], there are approximately 1200 students. Of those 1196 of them are white. The few black kids are excluded. \r\n\r\nGCHS Teens tend to get into exceptional colleges, many Ivy League.
